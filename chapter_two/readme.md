# Recursions


Every Recursive Solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion. Otherwise it will end up being an infinite loop.


It maybe simplify solution but it does not alwasy translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.


Let's see the example of recursion on fibonacci series.
