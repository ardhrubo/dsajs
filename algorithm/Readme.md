 - Search
 - Sorting


## Algorithm Design Techniques

    1. Brute force - Simple and exhaustive techniques that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution. Ex: Linear Search

    2. Greedy- Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future. Ex: Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.

    3. Divide and conquer - Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
    Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution. Ex: Binary search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Tower of Hanoi.

    4. Dynamic Programming - Divide the problem into smaaller sub-problems. Break it down into smaller but overalapping sub problems. Store the results and reuse it for the same sub problems. This is called memoization and is a optimaization technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm. Ex: Fibonacci numbers and climbing staircase.

    5. Backtracking - Generate all possible solutions. Check if the solution satisfy all the given constrains and only then proceed with generating subsequent solutions. If the constraints are onot satisfies, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution. Ex: N-Queens Problem
