# Algorithm Recap and Solution Repository

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithms and algorithm design techniques including brute force, greedy methods, dynamic programming, backtracking, and divide-and-conquer approaches.

## Key Algorithms

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
   - Implemented using Euclidean Algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers.
   
2. **Permutations and Combinations**
   - Code to generate all permutations and combinations from a given list of numbers.

3. **Longest Common Substring**
   - Dynamic programming solution to find the longest substring shared between two strings.

4. **Knapsack Problem**
   - 0/1 Knapsack problem implemented using dynamic programming to find the optimal value that can be carried under a weight constraint.

## Algorithm Design Techniques
- **Brute Force**: Exhaustively searches through all solutions.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each step.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks problems into smaller sub-problems and combines results.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaks problems into overlapping sub-problems and optimizes by storing intermediate results.
- **Backtracking**: Explores all solutions by searching through possible states, abandoning solutions that donâ€™t satisfy constraints.
