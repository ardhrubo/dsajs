Array :

An array is a data structure that hold a collection of values.
It is a linear data structure.

Arrays can contain a mix of different data types.You can strore
numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

Arrays are resizable. You don't need to specify the size of the array
before creating it.

Javascript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertions order is maintained.

Arrays are iterable. Then can be used with a for of loop.
