/*

Queue :

The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of FIFO(First in First Out)

The first elemenmt inserted into the queue is the first element 
to be removed.

A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end(rear/tail) and leave the other end (front/head).


Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model.

The data structure supports two main operations
    1. Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection.
    2. Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/had of the
    collection.
