# Queue

The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of FIFO (First In First Out). The first element inserted into the queue is the first element to be removed.

## Example

A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the other end (front/head).

## Abstract Data Type

Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

## Operations

The queue data structure supports two main operations:
1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection.
2. **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front/head of the collection.

## Queue Usage

Queues are used in various applications, including:
- **Task Scheduling**: Queues are used to manage tasks in operating systems and other scheduling applications.
- **Print Queue**: Managing print jobs in a printer queue.
- **Breadth-First Search**: Queues are used in graph traversal algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Buffering**: Queues are used in buffering data streams, such as in IO operations and network data handling.
