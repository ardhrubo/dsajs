# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node.

## Characteristics

- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a linked list can grow or shrink dynamically, allowing for efficient memory usage.
- **Ease of Insertion/Deletion**: Elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
- **Sequential Access**: Random access of elements is not feasible; accessing an element has linear time complexity (O(n)).

## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.


## Linked List Usage
    1. All application of both stacks and queues are application of linked lists
    2. Image viewer


## Linked List Operations

- **Insertion**: Adds an element at the beginning, end, or at a specified position.
- **Deletion**: Removes an item given its index or value.
- **Search**: Finds an element given its value.
- **Traversal**: Accesses each element in the list sequentially.

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence:
