# Stack

The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Example

A stack of plates. The last plate added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Abstract Data Type

Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

## Operations

The stack data structure has two main operations:
1. **push**: Adds an element to the stack.
2. **pop**: Removes the most recently added element.
