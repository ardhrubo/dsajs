# Stack

The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Example

A stack of plates. The last plate added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Abstract Data Type

Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

## Operations

The stack data structure has two main operations:
1. **push**: Adds an element to the stack.
2. **pop**: Removes the most recently added element.


## Stack Usage

Stacks are used in various applications, including:
- **Function Call Management**: Stacks are used to manage function calls in programming languages. When a function is called, its details are pushed onto the stack, and when the function returns, its details are popped from the stack.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, especially in compilers and calculators.
- **Undo Mechanisms**: Stacks are used to implement undo mechanisms in text editors and other applications.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Stacks are used in parsing expressions and syntax in compilers.
