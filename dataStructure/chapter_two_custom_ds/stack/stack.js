/*
Stack:

The stack data structure is a sequential colelction of elements that
follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last element added
to the stack is the first one to be removed.


A stack of plates.
The last plate added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than
being a mathematical model.

The stack data structure has two main operations:
1. push: Adds an element to the stack.
2. pop: Removes the most recently added element.
