# Data Structures in JavaScript

## What is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a systematic way of organizing and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. By using the right data structure, we can optimize the performance of various operations such as searching, inserting, deleting, and sorting data.

## Why Learn Data Structures?

Data structures are essential because they allow us to:

- **Efficiently store and organize data**: Choosing the right structure helps in reducing time and space complexity.
- **Perform operations effectively**: With well-structured data, algorithms can process and manipulate data more easily.
- **Build better algorithms**: Data structures are the foundation of algorithms. Without understanding data structures, writing optimized algorithms becomes challenging.

Understanding and applying the appropriate data structure leads to better software performance and scalability.

## Examples of Common Data Structures:

- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Implemented as a **Tree** data structure.
- **Browser Back and Forward Buttons**: Work based on the **Stack** data structure.
- **Operating System Job Scheduling**: Uses the **Queue** data structure to manage tasks.
- **Array**: A fundamental **Linear** data structure commonly used in programming.

## Built-in Data Structures in JavaScript:

JavaScript provides several built-in data structures that you can use directly:

- **Array**: An ordered list of elements.
- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Map**: A collection of key-value pairs with keys of any data type.
- **Set**: A collection of unique values.

## Custom Data Structures in JavaScript:

In addition to built-in structures, JavaScript allows developers to implement custom data structures to meet specific needs:

- **Stack**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Linked List**: A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, useful for representing networks.
- **Hash Table**: A structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookups.
